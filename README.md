# bsd-dotfiles
## Introduction
My simple config files excluding very personal setups. This is not intended to be
cloned, but a backup for my future bsd installations. I try to be very minimalist and
coherent to the unix philosophy.

## Softwares use
* Vim
My vim config set.

* Terminator
My messy terminator configuration.

* i3
The default i3 with very little addings.

* Fish
Modified for obviously privacy.
